üìò Blockchain Network Topology Prediction using Graph Neural Networks (GNN)

üîπ Project Overview

This project demonstrates how Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can be used to analyze and predict the evolution of blockchain network topology ‚Äî that is, how nodes and connections (edges) in a blockchain network may change over time.

In a blockchain system, participants (miners, wallets, or smart contracts) interact through transactions forming a graph network.
Using GNNs, we can learn these interaction patterns and predict future links or structural changes (for example, which new nodes will likely connect or which existing edges may strengthen).

This web-based demo simulates such behavior visually using Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)-inspired link prediction logic.

üß† Aim

To employ Graph Neural Networks for predicting and analyzing blockchain network topology evolution, i.e., how nodes and edges evolve over time.

üìÇ Dataset

Input: Blockchain transaction/network graph datasets
(Nodes = participants, Edges = transactions).

In this demo, the dataset can be uploaded as a JSON file or generated randomly.
Example JSON:

{
  "nodes": [{"id": "N1"}, {"id": "N2"}, {"id": "N3"}],
  "edges": [{"from": "N1", "to": "N2"}, {"from": "N2", "to": "N3"}]
}

‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection

Gather blockchain transaction data.

Each participant (address or node) is a node.

Each transaction between participants is an edge.


2Ô∏è‚É£ Graph Construction

Build an Adjacency Matrix (A) representing node connections.

Build a Feature Matrix (X) representing node properties (degree, role, transaction count, etc.).


3Ô∏è‚É£ Preprocessing

Normalize the adjacency matrix.

Split data into training, validation, and testing subsets.


4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Design (Graph Convolutional Network)

Use Graph Convolutional Layers:

Input Layer ‚Üí Hidden Layer(s) ‚Üí Output Layer


Learn graph embeddings from node features and connectivity.


5Ô∏è‚É£ Training

Train using loss functions like cross-entropy.

Use optimizers such as Adam or SGD.


6Ô∏è‚É£ Prediction

Predict future edges (link prediction) or node roles.

The demo uses a probabilistic + heuristic simulation to show likely new connections.


7Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluation

Measure results using metrics like:

Accuracy

Precision, Recall, F1-Score

AUC (Area Under ROC Curve)

üí° Algorithm Used

Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)
A GCN extends neural networks to operate directly on graph-structured data.

Simplified Forward Pass:

H^{(l+1)} = \sigma(\hat{A}H^{(l)}W^{(l)})

 = Node embeddings at layer l

 = Normalized adjacency matrix

 = Learnable weights

 = Activation function (ReLU)


This process aggregates information from each node‚Äôs neighbors to learn network patterns.
